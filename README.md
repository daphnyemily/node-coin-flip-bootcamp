# ðŸ’¸ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Node Coin Flip Game

### Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules. Use http to create the server and fs to read your html file. Include vanilla ES6 js in a script tag at the bottom of your html file. Try creating a coin flip guessing game

I completed the challenge: 4

I feel good about my code: 4
 
This project was confusing at first, but I was over thinking how to get my server.js to work. After some edits and help from members of team garner it was easy to grasp. Still learning how it all works but the project worked out well. I would love to add a spinning coin animation but we'll save that for later.
